# Tabs with routes.

Click [Tabs](https://github.com/Yaroslav-Radchuk/tabs-test-task.git) to see the demonstration. 

Main task:

In this application you can see tabs project with routes, currency tables against the EUR, lists of food and ingredients, and a list of movies. Also, if the link is incorrect, you will see an error and a button to return to the home page.

I used these technologies: `React`, `TypeScript`, `React Hooks`, `React Router`, `Fetch`, `Promise`, `SCSS`, `NPM`.
